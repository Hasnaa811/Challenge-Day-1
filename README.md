# Challenge-Day-1
Magic Page Challenge
In today's challenge, you will apply everything you learned so far to try and see to what use all concepts you discovered so far.
We will proceed to create a magic page, using the elements we studied before.
First up, set up an empty index.html file in a website folder.
Add your html structure to that file, and remember all the tags we used before.
Set the title of your page to "My Magic Page".
In your body, first up create a <nav> tag with a class of "navigation".
ðŸ’¡ Tags could hold any name you want, html is a permissive markup language, we will get to that later.
Inside your nav tag, create an input tag of type="checkbox" and of id navigationCheckbox.
<input type="checkbox" id="navigationCheckbox" />
After your input tag, and still, inside your nav tag, add in a <span> tag with an id of "burger".
Now add an unordered list with a class of "nav-menu".
<h2>An Unordered HTML List</h2>
â€‹
<ul>
  ...
  ...
</ul>
Add five listed items to your unordered list: 
Coffee
Tea
Milk
Eggs
Meat
Make sure all your tags are closed and save your file.
Verify your file looks close to perfectly like this:
An Unordred HTML List
if your page looks exactly like this one, congratulations, you have successfully completed the challenge, or maybe not! Let's now see how important IDs and Classes are to make a beautiful page.
Download this file : 
Download the file and insert it inside your project folder
After downloading the file and placing it inside your folder, proceed to add this line inside your head tag : 
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
Save and refresh your page!

Impressive huh? Do not pay too much attention to the file you added right now, we will come back to that later.
